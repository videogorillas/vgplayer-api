# Frame Accuracy and seeking behavior

Note: Timeline calculation is any calculation involving frame numbers or timecodes.

Note: correct seeking to arbitrary time expressed in seconds depends on browser implementation.
For example having B-frames in video stream will break any seeking accuracy for sure.

The player has 3 different levels of frame accurate operation.

- [frame accurate playback/seeking guaranteed](#FrameAccuracy_accurate)
- [frame accurate timeline calculations guaranteed](#FrameAccuracy_timeline)
- [frame accuracy is NOT guaranteed](#FrameAccuracy_generic)

## <a id="FrameAccuracy_accurate"></a> Frame accurate playback

The player can guarantee frame accurate playback and seeking when ALL of these conditions are met:

- .mp4/.mov or DASH or VG Proxy
- video stream codec settings are as described in [Generic Proxy Spec](VGProxySpec.md#GenericProxy_Codec)

Additionally in case of .mp4/.mov file:

- CORS enabled
- Range requests enabled

Additionally in case of DASH:

- segment timeline in .mpd file
- frame information in .mpd file. Required only for variable frame rate. Generated by Adapter.

## <a id="FrameAccuracy_timeline"></a> Frame accurate timeline

In some cases the player can guarantee correct timecodes and frame numbers but NOT frame accurate seeking.
Timeline calculations will be correct if ALL of these conditions are met:

- .mp4/.mov file
- any codec that is supported by the browser
- CORS enabled
- Range requests enabled


## <a id="FrameAccuracy_generic"></a> No guarantees. Default/Generic playback

If timeline accuracy can not be guaranteed the player uses fallback loading method.
In that case you will see `loadGeneric()` in the console. HLS always loads this way.

Limitations of the method:

- number and type of audio tracks is unknown, assumed to be 2 channel stereo
- can not switch between audio tracks
- frame rate is unknown, assumed to be 24000/1001. Timeline calculations are incorrect if video frame rate is not 24000/1001.
